## Overview
---
The project is a personal website showcasing my web development skills and portfolio. It allows visitors to explore projects, view my resume, and learn about my abilities. Using HTML, CSS (including Bootstrap), and JavaScript ensures an engaging user experience.

### File Structure Explanation

The file structure for WD-Finals organizes a web development portfolio or personal website with an index.html homepage and readme.md documentation file. It includes an "assets" directory for CSS, image files (JPEG, JPG, WebP, PNG), and JavaScript, while the "pages" directory categorizes sections like projects, resume, about, and contacts, each with their own index.html and asset subfolders for streamlined navigation and maintenance.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure below.
